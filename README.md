Week 6 questions

Program 1
Q.Write a C Program to find Largest Element of an Integer Array. 
Here the number of elements in the array ‘n’ and the elements of the array is read from the test data. 
Use the printf statement given below to print the largest element.
printf("Largest element = %d", largest);

Program 2
Q.Write a C Program to print the array elements in reverse order (Not reverse sorted order. Just the last element will become first element, second last element will become second element and so on)
Here the size of the array, ‘n’ and the array elements is accepted from the test case data. The last part i.e. printing the array is also written. 
You have to complete the program so that it prints in the reverse order. 

Program 3
Q.Write a C program to read Two One Dimensional Arrays of same data type (integer type) and merge them into another One Dimensional Array of same type.

Program 4
Q.Write a C Program to delete duplicate elements from an array of integers. 

Program 5
Q.C Program to delete an element from a specified location of an Array starting from array[0] as the 1st position, array[1] as second position and so on. 


week 7 programs

Program 1
Q.Write a C Program to Count Number of Uppercase and Lowercase Letters in a given string. The string may be a word or a sentence.

Program 2
Q.Write a C program to find the sum of all elements of each row of a matrix.

   Example: For a matrix  4 5 6

                                        6 7 3

                                        1 2 3

  The output will be 

  15

  16

   6

Program 3
Q.Write a C program to find subtraction of two matrices i.e. matrix_A - matrix_B=matrix_C.

 If the given martix are 

 2 3 5     and  1 5 2    Then the output will be  1 -2 3

 4 5 6             2 3 4                                           2 2 2

 6 5 7             3 3 4                                           3 2 3

 The elements of the output matrix are separated by one blank space 

Program 4
Q.Write a C program to print lower triangle of a square matrix.
For example the output of a given matrix 

2 3 4     will be       2 0 0

5 6 7                      5 6 0

4 5 6                      4 5 6

Program 5
Q.Write a C program to print Largest and Smallest Word from a given sentence. If there are two or more words of same length then the first one is considered. 
Here single letter such as "I" , "a" is considered as a word.
